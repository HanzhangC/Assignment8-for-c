In this code, I implemented a process manager simulation that handles CPU scheduling and memory management. The program simulates round-robin scheduling, with tasks focusing on different memory strategies such as infinite, contiguous, paged, and virtual memory allocation. It manages processes by tracking their states, allocating memory, and calculating performance metrics like turnaround time and time overhead. The goal is to efficiently schedule and execute processes while managing memory resources in a simulated environment.
